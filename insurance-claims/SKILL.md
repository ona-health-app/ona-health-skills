name: insurance-claims
description: Use this skill for insurance-claims operations with Stedi whenever the user asks to submit claims, validate claim payloads, check claim status, retrieve/interpret 277CA or 835 responses, troubleshoot payer/provider enrollment requirements, or build deterministic claims workflows. Trigger this skill even if the user does not say "Stedi" explicitly but mentions 837/835/277CA/ERA, payer IDs, claim rejection codes, claim resubmission, COB, or healthcare clearinghouse automation.

# insurance-claims

Deterministic, API-first insurance claims workflow skill.

## Operating principles

1. Use **Stedi API + deterministic scripts** for validations, submissions, status checks, and retrieval workflows.
2. Prefer structured JSON inputs/outputs. Avoid ad-hoc, ambiguous steps.
3. Run a **requirements preflight** before claim actions (payer support, enrollment status, provider identifiers, environment safety).
4. Fail fast with actionable remediation steps when prerequisites are not met.
5. Keep PHI exposure minimal in logs and outputs.

## Read path (progressive disclosure)

Start with:
- `references/stedi-overview.md`

Then read only what is needed:
- Submission design: `references/stedi-submitting-claims.md`
- Response handling: `references/stedi-claim-responses.md`
- Practical constraints: `references/stedi-best-practices.md`
- Rejections/resubmissions lifecycle: `references/stedi-claim-lifecycle.md`
- Enrollment/payer requirements: `references/stedi-enrollment-and-payers.md`
- Test workflows: `references/stedi-testing.md`
- Attachments and MCP context: `references/stedi-attachments-and-mcp.md`
- Provider/payer requirement preflight: `references/provider-requirements.md`

## Deterministic workflow

Follow this sequence unless user explicitly requests otherwise.

1. **Classify task**
   - One of: `validate_claim`, `submit_claim`, `check_claim_status`, `lookup_payer`, `retrieve_277ca`, `retrieve_835era`, `poll_transactions`, `resubmit_or_void`.

2. **Run preflight requirements check**
   - Resolve payer ID.
   - Verify transaction support.
   - Verify enrollment requirement and status.
   - Verify provider identifiers (NPI and any payer-specific requirements).
   - Verify environment consistency (test vs production).
   - If any check fails, stop and return deterministic remediation.

3. **Use script stubs/interfaces (or real implementation when present)**
   - `scripts/validate_claim.py`
   - `scripts/submit_claim.py`
   - `scripts/check_claim_status.py`
   - `scripts/lookup_payer.py`
   - `scripts/retrieve_277ca.py`
   - `scripts/retrieve_835era.py`
   - `scripts/poll_transactions.py`

4. **Correlate all transactions**
   - Primary key: `patientControlNumber`.
   - Secondary key: Stedi `correlationId`.
   - Line-level key: service-line control number.

5. **Return structured output**
   - Include status summary, key identifiers, and next action suggestions.

## Script usage contract

Use these interfaces unless user requests a different shape.

- `validate_claim.py`
  - Input: JSON payload path
  - Output:
    ```json
    { "valid": true, "errors": [], "warnings": [] }
    ```

- `submit_claim.py`
  - Input: claim type (`professional|institutional|dental`), payload, optional test flag
  - Output:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "correlationId": "...",
      "patientControlNumber": "...",
      "errors": []
    }
    ```

- `check_claim_status.py`
  - Output:
    ```json
    {
      "claims": [
        { "statusCategoryCode": "...", "statusCode": "...", "description": "..." }
      ]
    }
    ```

- `lookup_payer.py`
  - Output:
    ```json
    {
      "payers": [
        { "payerId": "...", "name": "...", "aliases": [], "supportedTransactions": [] }
      ]
    }
    ```

- `retrieve_277ca.py` / `retrieve_835era.py` / `poll_transactions.py`
  - Return normalized, parser-friendly objects with deterministic fields.

## Required guardrails

- Authentication: read API key from `STEDI_API_KEY`.
- Always include idempotency keys on submission requests.
- Validate PCN format (alphanumeric, <=17 chars) and uniqueness.
- Avoid reserved delimiter characters in JSON data where applicable.
- Use `usageIndicator: "T"` for test submissions and `"P"` for production.
- Do not claim adjudication outcome from 277CA alone.
- Treat duplicate webhooks/responses as normal; deduplicate by transaction and payment trace keys.

## Resubmission policy

When user asks to fix/retry/cancel claims:
- Use lifecycle rules in `references/stedi-claim-lifecycle.md`.
- Determine if claim entered payer system before choosing frequency code.
- Include PCCN where required for replacement/void flows.
- Generate a new PCN on each resubmission.

## Output format for user responses

When performing claims tasks, return:

1. `What I did` (short)
2. `Result` (status + key IDs)
3. `Why` (if rejected/blocked)
4. `Next actions` (numbered, deterministic)

Example:

```json
{
  "action": "submit_claim",
  "status": "blocked",
  "reason_code": "ENROLLMENT_REQUIRED",
  "context": {
    "providerNpi": "1999999984",
    "payerId": "6400",
    "transactionType": "835"
  },
  "nextActions": [
    "Submit enrollment request for 835",
    "Wait for enrollment status live",
    "Retry submission with same validated payload structure"
  ]
}
```

## What to avoid

- Do not skip preflight checks for payer/provider requirements.
- Do not use vague advice when a deterministic action is possible.
- Do not expose full PHI payloads unless user explicitly requests and context is safe.
- Do not mix test and production assumptions in one run.
