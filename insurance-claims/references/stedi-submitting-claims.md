## API-first model

For this skill, use Stedi APIs with direct HTTP calls. Prefer JSON endpoints so you can validate structured payloads before submission and parse structured responses after submission.

Stedi translates JSON to HIPAA X12 for payer routing and returns JSON responses.

## Endpoints by claim type

- `837P` Professional claims (JSON): Professional Claims endpoint
- `837I` Institutional claims (JSON): Institutional Claims endpoint
- `837D` Dental claims (JSON): Dental Claims endpoint
- Raw X12 variants exist for each claim type if needed later

Use payer ID (`tradingPartnerServiceId`) from Payer Network/Payers API.

## Required headers

Every submission request should include:

- `Authorization: <STEDI_API_KEY>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Idempotency-Key: <unique-key>` (strongly recommended)

Idempotency keys prevent duplicate submissions during network retries.

## Required high-level JSON objects

Across claims, these top-level structures are central:

- `tradingPartnerServiceId`
- `tradingPartnerName`
- `submitter`
- `receiver`
- `subscriber` (and optional `dependent`)
- `claimInformation`
- Provider section (for example `billing`; plus rendering/attending structures by claim type)

Commonly required inside `claimInformation`:
- `patientControlNumber`
- `claimChargeAmount`
- `claimFrequencyCode`
- `claimFilingCode`
- Service line array (`serviceLines`)

## Professional claim skeleton (837P)

Use this as a starter payload shape for claim submissions.

          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For test submissions, set:
- `usageIndicator: "T"` (JSON)

## Institutional and dental differences

### Institutional (837I)
- Includes facility/admission style data and institutional coding constructs.
- May require revenue-code oriented service lines and institutional claim pricing/adjudication elements.

### Dental (837D)
- Includes dental-specific procedure context (for example tooth/surface/oral cavity structures where applicable).
- Uses ADA-oriented coding patterns.

Implementation note: use the separate payload templates per claim type from `assets/` to avoid mixed-field errors.

## Conditional requirements

Stedi uses required + conditionally required objects:
- Required means always present.
- Conditional means required only in certain scenarios.

Example pattern:
- `subscriber` is broadly required.
- `dependent` may be omitted when patient is subscriber.
- A provider supervisory structure may be required only in supervised care situations.

Pre-flight validation recommendation:
- Validate the payload locally before submission and classify failures as:
  - `missing_required`
  - `missing_conditional`
  - `format_error`

## Coordination of benefits fields

For secondary/tertiary submissions:
- Set `subscriber.paymentResponsibilityLevelCode` to:
  - `S` for secondary
  - `T` for tertiary
- Include prior payer adjudication details in `claimInformation.otherSubscriberInformation`.
- Include claim-level and line-level adjudication amounts from prior payer ERA when required.

## Attachments overview for submissions

If claim requires supporting documents:
- Include attachment reference fields in claim payload (`attachmentReportTypeCode`, `attachmentTransmissionCode`, and attachment identifier field).
- For JSON workflows, create/upload attachment first and pass attachment ID in claim submission fields.

See `stedi-attachments-and-mcp.md` for full attachment flow.
